# Backend Web Development

Backend web development refers to the server-side part of web applications. It focuses on how a website works, updates, and changes. It is responsible for managing and handling the data exchange between the server, the application, and the database.

## Key Components

### 1. Server
A **server** is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In web development, the server receives requests from the client (browser), processes them, and sends back the appropriate response.

### 2. Application
The **application** is the backend logic that processes client requests, applies business rules, and determines how data should be handled. It is usually written in programming languages like Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP.

### 3. Database
A **database** is a system used to store, retrieve, and manage data. The backend application communicates with the database to read or write data as needed. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.

## How It Works

1. The client (browser) sends a request to the server.
2. The server forwards the request to the backend application.
3. The application processes the request, often interacting with the database.
4. The application sends the response back to the server.
5. The server returns the response to the client.

Backend development ensures that data is stored securely, business logic is enforced, and the application runs smoothly.
